## 🤖❤️🤗 What is ROS4HRI?  

ROS4HRI is a collection of open-source resources built around the [Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI)](http://wiki.ros.org/hri) paradigm, enabling robots to
meaningfully perceive, interpret and respond to humans in shared spaces and
applications.

At its heart, ROS4HRI is a set of ROS 1/ROS 2-compatible conventions, libraries, and tools
designed to streamline the development of HRI systems. It aligns and implements
the [ROS REP-155](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0155.html).

➡️  [Go to the DOCUMENTATION](https://ros4hri.github.io/) ⬅️

Within this organization you’ll find standard implementations and libraries for
the REP-155 messages and abstractions, as well as modules for human skeleton
tracking, face detection, full-body modeling, engagement estimation, and other
key components for HRI applications. See the documentation above for a full list.

## 🤝 Contributing  

We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug-reports, feature requests, pull-requests, documentation improvements, and new HRI modules.  
To contribute:

- Fork the target repository.
- Create a feature or fix branch.
- Make sure your code follows the existing style conventions and passes any included tests.
- Submit a Pull Request and reference the issue(s) it addresses.
- Engage in review — we aim for clarity, correctness and maintainability.

## 📢 Stay Connected  

- Check the **Issues** tab of each repository for upcoming work and current priorities.
- If you build an HRI use-case with ROS4HRI, we’d love to hear about it -- drop a link or case study.
